        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="badge">Effective date: January 1, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>FYNX Pro</strong> is a set of trading utilities for iOS. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it’s used, and the choices available. The goal is simple: collect only what is needed to make the app work well, keep it for as little time as possible, and never sell it.</p>

        <h2>What is collected</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Purchase validation</strong> — information handled by Apple to enable Pro features (for example: subscription status, product identifiers, and receipt validation). Raw payment details are never received.</li>
          <li><strong>Support submissions (optional)</strong> — details voluntarily provided when contacting Support via the <a href="support.html">Support page</a> (for example: name, email, message). This is used only to reply and resolve the request.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnostics (optional)</strong> — basic crash and performance data that helps improve stability. Advertising identifiers are not used.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          FYNX Pro does not request precise location, contact list, photos, or tracking across other companies’ apps and websites.
        </div>

        <h2>How the data is used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and maintain core app functionality.</li>
          <li>Validate purchases and manage access to Pro features.</li>
          <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
          <li>Improve reliability, fix bugs, and understand app performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Processing & storage</h2>
        <p>Most processing occurs on the device. Limited purchase and diagnostics data is processed by Apple and trusted service providers required to operate the app and Support inbox. Data is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes above and then deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>Personal data is not sold. Data may be shared only with service providers that help operate the app (for example, Apple for in-app purchases and error reporting) or when required by law. Providers are bound to use the data only for the requested service.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> — disable optional diagnostics in iOS Settings if preferred.</li>
          <li><strong>Support data</strong> — to request deletion of a previous support message, send a note via the <a href="support.html">Support page</a> and include the email address used and approximate date.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>FYNX Pro is not directed to children under 13. If a child has provided information, contact Support and it will be removed.</p>

        <h2>International use</h2>
        <p>If using the app from outside your country, information may be processed in regions where service providers operate. Appropriate safeguards are applied to protect the data.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This policy may be updated as the app evolves. When changes are made, the “Effective date” above will be revised. For material changes, a notice may appear in-app or on this site.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
